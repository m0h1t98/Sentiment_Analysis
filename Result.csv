Good product,"Phone is perfect for the price range but it doesn't have gorilla glass so screen can broke easily and can get scratched, so do not drop it and buy a back cover It comes with a ordinary screen protector though. Picture quality is best in this class I can assure you that. Sound quality is loud and clear. Bettery life is good can last a day with average usage. Best point is it does not get hot during heavy tasks and while charging or while talking for long time. Face recognition does not work in low light. If your fingers are dirty, oily or wet the finger print scanner will not open your lock which I think is a good point because it means it is more safer and will not open if someone try to open it with a fake finger print of yours UI (user interface) is best which EMUI its has its own app locker, and a safe which can encrypt your data with your finger print and password, you can store files in it which you don't want others to see. It has a split screen feature in which you can run 2 applications simultaneously. You can run videos over other app in a small window. These are some of its features. And the UI is constantly monitor the applications to increase battery performance and close them when you turn the screen off, it is a very good feature but it has some side effects like it won't let you run the music apps like vlc or any other music app in the background and you have to change the settings little bit to run them in background when screen is off, you have to remove the auto optimization over the music app you are using in the settings.

Over heating product from Motorola.,I disliked the product. It's overheating while using any app. And super heating while on charging. In fact it's so hot that I can iron my clothes with it.

Bad Camera. Depth of field is digital blur based on software,Pros: 1)Screen (Anti Glare) It does not hurt eyes at full brightness even at night. 2)Long lasting Battery - I get 3 days of backup with normal use. 3)Fast Fingerprint Response. 4)Smooth Gameplay. 5)Speakers are very loud and pleasing. Cons: 1)Very Bad Camera : The Picture Quality of REAR camera as well as FRONT Camera is too bad than expected. The blur in image is software based not with the actual lens. When I Cover the one lens then also blur works.In reality one lens works as a main camera The Video Quality is very poor even with dual camera. The Video is too shaky even if the hands are steady. 2)WIFI : The wifi chip is too weak and disconnects at low signals and has a poor download and upload speed. 3)Selfie Flash is not too bright and the auto mode in selfie light does not work properly My Samsung j5 prime keeps the lowest signal connected.,06-Mar-19,,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710CoduIVdL._SY88.jpg

Complete review of NOKIA 8 *it has a major screen burn in issue*,"I have used this device for a bit more than 3 months now. Its overall a good device. I'll list few cons that I faced:- - The screen is very prone to scratches - There is a lack of good back covers for this model, which is still bearable but what really bothers me is lack of screen guards, since it has rounded edges, whatever screen guard I use comes off very soon. - The screen, atleast in my case, I noticed some defects in the screen, for example there are 4 icons on the notification tray, which have been there for more than 15 mins, after I clear those icons the notifications are gone, but the pixels still show a translucent shadow of those icons for the next 10 mins, this happens for everything that is displayed on the screen for a while, after I remove that thing, it's shadow/ghost remains on that area of screen.  Other than that, the screen is good, the colours are good.  And to be honest I don't mind the thick bezels. - Heating problem, yes ofcourse it's there, it's a 6000 series aluminium frame body, and Indian weather conditions, but it also heats up on excessive use for more than 20-30 mins. - No notification lights or a way to know if you have any extra notifications other than emails, missed calls or SMS. The always on display only caters to these 3 types of notifications, to see any other notifications, you'll have to turn on the screen. - The camera use BUT ONLY REGARDS STILL IMAGES, the quality is not at par with the competition in this price range ( I bought it for ₹28,000). Now the pros of this device!!!! - The build quality. It's a Nokia device, as expected IT IS VERY VERY STURDY! I frankly didn't find the point of buying a back cover, but I had to, since my hands are a bit slippery. - Battery and charging, amazing!! Charges quickly and lasts me most of the day ! Example: I take it off charging at 8am, use it throughout the day for calls, texting, surfing, music, some videos but not a lot of them, in that case the battery lasts till 7 pm. - Camera Quality REGARDING VIDEOS CAPTURED ON NOKIA 8, the sound quality in the videos shot in this device is INSANE! It's too good! So is the video quality! - Does not hang, for me it hasn't. - Too much storage space !! I have a memory card in it and the device storage, I carelessly download media, never have got to worry about storage on this device. - The finger print sensor is fast and quite good! Not a single scratch on it yet. - No scratches on the camera glass either. This is something I appreciate. - Sound quality, for calls it's very crisp and loud enough. For playing media, it's a single bottom firing speaker but it's quite clear and loud, I'd use the word satisfying. - Making calls, I noticed that the microphone is quite nice, my voice goes through clear and crisp. Also compared to other device I used with the same SIM, sitting on the same spot, I notice Nokia 8 recieved better signal for me. - In box earphones!!! First of all not all manufacturers give those, I'm glad Nokia does. Good sound, mic and button quality! In fact I think I'd like to buy an extra set of these. - Charger, fast and efficient. - Clean android, I do get monthly updates for security patches. All in all, I'd say I'm satisfied having bought this device. Even though I still have to get the screen replaced under warranty I guess, but all the same, enjoying it.",04-Oct-18,,,Yes,Sunny,3,"Nokia 8 (Polished Blue, 64GB)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-8-Polished-Blue-64GB/product-reviews/B0714DP3BJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Beware, Nokia fleecing customer just after warranty","Phone started showing problems after 1 year from the date of purchase. So no warranty. After March 2019 software update phone speaker started giving screeching noise, phone restarts when camera app is opened, if the remaining charge in the battery is less than 70% you never know when the phone will restart. Nokia support asked me to do factory reset, spent a lot of time doing the reset, did not solve the problem. Took the phone to the Nokia service centre. They told it's a battery problem. When probed why this has to happen after a software update they reluctantly told that Nokia has prescryto change the battery to fix the problem at the customer's cost. The battery change costed INR 2860/-. Effectively, Nokia is ripping their trusting customer's money with a software update after the warranty is over.

STAY AWAY FROM NOKIA 8 LIKE PLAGUE,"Nokia used to make very reliable phones. But, then slowly it showed quality degradation. At last, when Nokia 8 came with lot of hype, I trusted it and bought it for my mother as a gift. After 11 months of buying the phone, it started resetting itself often. At first, it was occuring only for the camera. Then, Whatsapp, Facebook, Google search, Phone call and even when unlocking the phone, this annoying thing started coming. Basically, the phone has become useless. Unfortunately, the nearest Nokia service center was 1.5 hrs from my home and my mother couldn't go there when the phone was still in warranty period. I was outside the country. I came back to India a week after the great 1 year warranty was over. I took it to the Nokia authorized service center and they said they'll resolve it in two days. I went after two days, got the phone, was coming back home. In the bus, I again saw the same glitch coming. I called the service center and I was told to go there again with the phone. I went back and gave the phone again. This time, they promised me that they'll do a full diagnosis and definitely fix the issue. They took a week and gave me a call. I went back, received the phone. But, there itself I found the same reset issue appearing. They said they'll have to replace the PCB, though a minute earlier they said they've fixed the issue. Replacing the PCB will cost 22,000. And there is no guarantee that the issue or some other issue won't happen. I called Nokia helpline and they said they can't do anything, but keep making cheap quality junk like this with 1 year warranty. Nokia has lost it's brand value. I will never ever buy another Nokia. Go for Samsung. Period. I lost a chunk of money for which Nokia is fully responsible. Now, that phone can only be used as paperweight since that reset happens continuously and no functions of the phone can be used. My suggestion to any potential buyer, don't fall into the trap, seeing the list of specifications. None of them will be usable.",03-Feb-19,,,Yes,Rahul V.,1,"Nokia 8 (Polished Blue, 64GB)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-8-Polished-Blue-64GB/product-reviews/B0714DP3BJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

0 stars for Motorola,Motorola really deserves a 0 star rating for how well their service centres and customer care manages to dissappoint their customers. However good the product may seem never buy a Motorola product just for the way they treat their customers after purchase. It has been more than 1 year since i have been using this phone and i have been literally fighting with the service centre every now and then. Every single visit of mine to the service centre somehow ends up in a fight and i do find most of my fellow customers either supporting me or starting a fight all by themselves all through the durations of time that i spend there. From my experience i can easily say this is the worst mobile service centre you can find. If you still want to go ahead and buy a Motorola make sure you completely know how to repair your phone or make sure you do know someone who can help.

Review after 10 months of use,I am writing this review after 10 months. So here I am sharing my personal experiences with this phone: First of all thanks to Amazon for its prompt delivery and thanks to Seller Darshita Electronics for sending this product in good condition. Pros: Build Quality: Very good build quality Performance: Performance is very good no lags are experienced till now. Sound Quality: Good but not much loud. I liked it personally. Camera Quality: Good in Outdoor also 4K video recording is bundled. FingerPrint Scanner: Responsive scanner. It detects the finger print quite fast. Battery Backup: Good if you are on Android Nougat. It stays almost one day of heavy usage. TurboCharging: Fast charging is available on this device and it charges quickly. Cons: Camera Quality: Disappointed with image processing from this camera. i can say it was below average. The Dual Camera setup was a disappointment. But soon Motorola had released the camera updates and it improved in great extent. I can say the Dual camera is properly implemented after lot of updates from Motorola. Color reproduction of this camera is a below average it did not process the image if i compare it with Google camera which is installed in my device and also very surprised that images shot with Google camera app are far better than the Motorola's stock camera app as it is using same sensor. Don't know why Motorola is not working on the camera quality. Camera Bumps: As we know that Camera Bumps are bit outwards on this model so there is a chance for scratches on the camera glass so better to have a protective back cover with camera protection. Regular Updates: Updates are not in the list of Motorola as they are focusing on their new models so ignoring the previous models. I have recently got the Oreo updates after so much waiting. Very poor service when it comes to the updates from Motorola. Battery backup: Battery backup deteriorates after upgrading to Android Oreo. I have noticed the next day i have to charge two time a day after upgrading. Now waiting for the next update hope this will be fixed in next update. Final Verdict: If you are a camera freak and expecting for some great shots then this phone will give you an average quality so better think for other options available in the market. But if you are an average user with some budget restrictions then go for it. The above said are my experiences with this phone and my overall rating for this phone will be 3.5.,09-Nov-18,Colour: Lunar Grey,,Yes,Pramod Nair,3,"Motorola G5s Plus (Lunar Grey, 64GB)",https://www.amazon.in/Moto-Plus-Lunar-Grey-64GB/product-reviews/B071HWTHPH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Neutral

Super,"I got the phone for 14k with Amazon prime 1000rs cash back offer.. it's a great phone for this price change. You can also get an exchange offer with your old phone, so basically it's a worthy deal. The pros are listed on basis of price point. Pros: 1. Durable, feels solid, looks premium ( I saw almost 15 phones around this range, everything else looks and feels very less premium) 2. Screen, primary camera and sound 3. Latest Android updates Cons For this price range Nokia could have added: 1.  a fast charging USB port , cable- ( which can be bought extra so problem solved as of now) 2. A better battery as It heats up a little( problem can be solved with a back cover) 3. Better front camera It is not slow as many claim to be...but if u are looking for super high performance with lightening speed phone and expect it to be available in 15k then it's quite high expectation.

Good value for money at this price range,"Post the price drop to around 27k this is very good value for money. You get the Nokia assurance. Good build quality. The snapdragon 835 is second best in the market.

Feel cheated by buying this cheap model,"The phone was working properly  for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened  it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with  serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.",15-Oct-18,,,Yes,Anil Arora,1,"Redmi 5 (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Black-3GB-32GB-Storage/product-reviews/B077PWBC7J/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Worth spending 10k,Honor 7c is one of the handsets that fits the price range and truly justifies for what you pay Front camera is good for selfies Back camera is good but as I am I phone user surely the pic quality does not match to that level Sound is very good you can enjoy movies on the go Watching movies on this large screen is really awsme Battery life is too good as I phone lacks in battery life.

A good phone,"Brought this phone in November. Have received pie update. >>This phone has amazing camera. Download Google camera mod for even better photos. >>Screen quality is good. I find even this size a little big. I hope manufacturers start releasing compact phones too. >>Moto gestures are amazing. >>I brought 32 gb model and put 32 gb memory card in it. So, no storage issues. You can even format sd card as internal memory. So, new apps can be installed on sd card. >>Ram is 3gb in my model. On average 1gb is free. >>All apps run fine, buttery smooth performance as of now. Pie update is stable. >>I tried some games, run without any lag. Didn't try big games but they will run smoothly too. you can check youtube videos for gaming performance. >>Battery life is good. Easily lasts one day. Phone heats up a little while charging but that's not a big issue. It's normal. >>Turbocharger charges battery very fast. >>Phone looks premium but it is little slippery because it has glass back. >>Pie update will be the last update that will be come on this phone. So people who always care about being on latest software should look for other models. >> Also security patches are not regular like nokia or google phones. On an average, you can hope to get security patch after 3 months or so As on now, 4 months have passed. I'm pretty satisfied.

Great product BUT .....,"So the thing is I've purchased this mobile a month ago and I'm more than satisfied to get the product at this price range . But alas it didn't last until the phones' touch screen stopped responding to the fingers and not working correctly from the past week. Called service centre and their cell's been switched off and no response from them so far .

Awesome,"I have been using this phone for almost 7 months and I would say its awesommeee... Camera is amazing (obviously it's a Zeiss lens), no heating up ( even after using network for more than 8hours and playing games) issues, battery is amazing (if you use it just for WhatsApp or fb it can even stay for 1 and half days without charging), speed is great. Even I have dropped it for atleast 3times but it's Nokia it's made for the rough life 😄. It's working all good. The only concern is while using the portrait mode or sometimes even normal modes in bright light (not under the  sun) the phone gets heated up. That might be because of the metal body. But it's working perfectly. So I would say always go for Nokia.. it's a huge YES.",18-Nov-18,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71M1LxpWAEL._SY88.jpg,Yes,Nivya James,5,"Nokia 8 (Polished Blue, 64GB)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-8-Polished-Blue-64GB/product-reviews/B0714DP3BJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good phone, needs camera and software updates optimization.","Few highlights after 1 year of usage:- 1) Battery: Lasts a day or more. Depends heavily on the usage. Sometimes drains with 4G and draining apps. 2) Camera: Expected a bit more from the camera especially the dual lens setup from Moto. It does a decent job but not top notch. Don't expect OnePlus like pictures (obviously) without editing. Selfie camera is good enough though. 3) Software: Bad experience here. Motorola management and devs need to up their game because we're getting Android Oreo after almost a year while Motorola promised it in early 2018. Only security patch updates were provided for a 16k phone with other competitors in the market. Software experience is stock though which is very good, no bloatware. 4) Gestures: I think the gestures and one button navigation is one of the best features of this smartphone. I use it on a daily basis (gestures only, not a big fan of single button navigation gestures but many people like it). 5) Turbo Charger: Very good, provides a great amount of charge in less time. One of the best that I've seen. But the cable plastic end got frayed. 6) Display & Design: Top notch for the price. One of the best in this price segment. However, the design gets wasted if you put it in a case :) 7) Rest: Snapdragon 625, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, no complaints here. Performance wise its good! (Funny though that Moto G6 has Snapdragon 450 for the same price at launch! What are you doing Moto?).",06-Oct-18,Colour: Lunar Grey,,Yes,Surya Saini,4,"Motorola G5s Plus (Lunar Grey, 64GB)",https://www.amazon.in/Moto-Plus-Lunar-Grey-64GB/product-reviews/B071HWTHPH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Positive
